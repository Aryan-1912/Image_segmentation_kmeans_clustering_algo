Simple Thresholding – Converts a grayscale image into black and white based on a fixed intensity value.

Adaptive Thresholding – Calculates thresholds for small regions of the image, handling varying lighting conditions.

K-Means Clustering – Groups pixels into k color clusters, producing a segmented image where similar colors are grouped together.

Libraries Used – OpenCV (image processing), NumPy (array operations), Matplotlib (visualization)
